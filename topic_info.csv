This was mainly attributable to lower finance costs of $[●] million due to lower interest rates and lower loan principals.\n•\tOur net cash generated from operating activities decreased by $[●] million from $[●] million in [year] to $[●] million in [year] due to an increase in credit sales that contributed to an increase in trade receivables of $[●] million from $[●] million in [year] to $[●] million in [year].\n•\tOur net assets increased by $[●] million from $[●] million in [year] to $[●] million in [year] mainly due to the $[●] million increase in inventories for our new product introduced in [year].\n\nThe above factors are not the only factors contributing to our financial performance in FY[●] and FY[●].

We have a strong management team with over 20 years of experience in the industry and the management team has contributed significantly to our Company’s growth and expansion since our incorporation in [year]. We aim to strengthen our position in this industry and region by expanding our operations to [names of countries] in the next 3 years.\n\nWe have also recently started a joint venture with [name of company] to enter into the [secondary business] market. We believe that there is a growing market for [secondary business] in [country] given the changing lifestyles of consumers in [country].\n\n\nRefer to the “[relevant section]” on page(s) [●] of the Offer document for more information on our strategies and future plans.\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY TRENDS, UNCERTANTIES, DEMANDS, COMMITMENTS OR EVENTS WHICH ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON US?\n[Where applicable, briefly discuss, for at least the current financial year, the Issuer’s or the Group’s (as the case may be) business and financial prospects, any significant recent trends in production, sales and inventory, and in the costs and selling prices of products and services, as well as any other known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the net sales or revenues, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause financial information disclosed in the Offer document to be not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition of the Issuer or the Group (as the case may be). If there are no such trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events, provide an appropriate statement to that effect.]\n\nExample:\n\nFor the current financial year, our Directors have observed the following trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the net sales or revenues, profitability, liquidity or capital resources of the Group, or that would cause financial information disclosed in the Offer document to be not necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial condition of the Group:\n\n(a)\tthe demand for [activity] has increased with the recent growth [country]’s economy. We expect our revenue from our [business segment] to increase in line with the increase in [activity]; and\n\n(b)\twe expect the upward trend in [activity] to have a positive impact on the demand for our [service].\n\nOperating costs are also expected to increase together with the increase in the level of [activity].\n\nThe above are not the only trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that could affect us.

The Issuer should not set out the entire list of risk factors found in the “Risk Factors” section of the Offer document.]\n\nExample:\n\nKEY RISKS\n\nWe consider the following to be the most important key risks which had materially affected or could materially affect our business operations, financial position and results, and your investment in our shares.\n\n•\tAn economic downturn could negatively affect our profitability: Our industry is exposed to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty of future economic prospects. Economic downturns could have an adverse impact on overall demand. This would result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\n\n•\tOur industry is highly competitive: We compete against numerous businesses and our competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources. We compete for customers, financing, employees and other resources. This creates both strong price and quality competition, which leads to increased costs in the form of marketing and customer services, in addition to price reductions. Our ability to compete effectively depends on several factors, including our market presence, our reputation, our competitors, and general trends in the industry and economy. There is no assurance that we can compete successfully.\n\n•\tA substantial proportion of our revenues is derived from several major customers and loss of their business may seriously impact our financial results: Our five largest customers accounted for approximately [●]% of our revenues for the year ended [year], and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately [●]% of our revenues for the year ended [year]. Our revenues may significantly decrease if we lose any of these customers or if our customers reduce their volume of business with us.\n\n•\tWe face risks associated with our business being conducted in [country]: As most of our operations are conducted in [country], our business may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully manage inherent risks including: unexpected political or economic developments; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; unfavourable tax consequences; adverse legal or regulatory changes; insufficient protection for intellectual property rights; and complexities relating to currency and capital transfers.\n\n•\tThe restrictions on our operating subsidiary’s ability to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund and operate our business: We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in [country]. Accordingly, we will rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, including the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses, service any debt we may incur, and pay any dividends that may be declared. The payment of dividends by [country] entities such as our subsidiaries is subject to limitations in accordance with the rules and regulations of [country], which may negatively affect our operations and profitability.\n\nThe above are not the only risk factors that had a material effect or could have a material effect on our business operations, financial position and results, and your shares. Refer to “[relevant section]” on page(s) [●] of the Offer document for a discussion on other risk factors and for more information on the above risk factors. Prior to making a decision to invest in our [shares/units], you should consider all the information contained in the Offer document.\nRefer to the “[relevant section]” on page(s) [●] of the Offer document for more information on risk factors.\nWHAT ARE THE RIGHTS ATTACHED TO THE SECURITIES OFFERED?\n[Describe the type and class of shares/units being offered, including the rights attached to the shares/units and any restrictions on the free transferability of shares/units.]\n\nExample:\n\nKey Information on Shares Offered\n\nAs of the date of this Offer document, our issued and paid up share capital was $[●] consisting of [●] shares.\n\nWe have only one class of shares, and the shares offered will have the same rights as our other existing issued and paid-up shares, including voting rights. Shareholders will be entitled to all rights attached to their shares in proportion to their shareholding, such as any cash dividends declared by the Company and any distribution of assets upon liquidation of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transferability of our shares.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to the “[relevant section]” on page(s) [●] of the Offer document for more information.\n\nHOW WILL THE PROCEEDS OF THE OFFER BE USED?\n[Provide information on the amount of proceeds raised from the offer will be allocated to each principal intended use. Information on the use of proceeds should be presented using diagrams (e.g. tables, graphs and charts) where appropriate.]\n\nExample:\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nThe net proceeds to be raised in the offer (after deducting estimated expenses to be borne by us) is $[●]. The following represents our estimate of the allocation of the gross proceeds expected to be raised from the offer, assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by vendors.\n\nDetails of utilisation\t$ (million)\tAllocation for each $1.00 gross proceeds raised\n(1)\tNet proceeds:\n(a)\tExpansion of business\n\n(b)\tWorking capital and general corporate purposes\t[●]\n\n[●]\t[●]\n\n[●]\n(2)\tOther estimated expenses\t[●]\t[●]\nTotal\t[●]\t1.00\nRefer to the “[relevant section]” on page(s) [●] of the Offer document for more information on our use of proceeds.\nWILL WE BE PAYING [DIVIDENDS/DISTRIBUTIONS] AFTER THE OFFER?\n[Describe (i) the dividends/distributions per share/unit, if any, paid by the Issuer for each of the 3 most recent completed financial years, and (ii) the Issuer’s dividend/distribution policy, or if it does not have a fixed policy, to state so. Provide clear and prominent disclosure of any existing or proposed arrangement that materially enhances short-term yields while potentially diluting long-term yields. The disclosure should include a computation of the forecast distribution yield assuming that the arrangements are not in place.]\n\nExample:\n\nOver the last three financial years ended 31 December [year], [year] and [year], we have not declared and distributed dividends. We currently do not have a fixed dividend policy. Any future payment of dividends by us would depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors. If we do not pay any dividends, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our shares, and our shares may be less valuable because return on investment will depend entirely on capital appreciation.\nRefer to the “[relevant section]” on page(s) [●] of the Offer document for more information on our [dividend / distribution] policy.\nDEFINITIONS\n[Provide definitions if necessary.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nWHO CAN YOU CONTACT IF YOU HAVE ENQUIRIES RELATING TO OUR OFFER?\nHOW DO YOU CONTACT US?\n[Provide contact details of Issuer, distributor(s)/underwriter(s) and/or issue manager(s) whom investors can contact if they have enquiries.

Some key considerations for PFP Applicants are the following:\n(a)\tBusiness Model\nThe FSRA will consider the PFP Applicant’s proposed business model and assess any potential risks it poses. In particular, the FSRA will consider:\n(i)\tthe nature and structure of the products offered on the PFP;\n(ii)\tthe PFP Applicant’s target Clients;\n(iii)\tthe roles and responsibilities of the PFP Applicant;\n(iv)\twhether the Applicant will carry out primary and/or secondary trading;\n(v)\twhether the PFP Applicant might have any perceived conflicts of interest when authorised and how these might be managed;\n(vi)\tany proposed outsourcing arrangements with third party service providers;\n(vii)\twhether the PFP Applicant is proposing to carry out any other Regulated Activities; and\n(viii)\tthe safekeeping arrangements for Client Assets if the PFP Applicant intends to hold these.\nIn the case that a PFP Applicant proposes to carry out other Regulated Activities such as Operating a MTF, Advising on Investments or Credit, Managing Assets or Managing a Collective Investment Fund, the PFP Applicant would need to demonstrate how it would manage any potential conflicts of interest that these activities may pose.\n(b)\tTrack Record\nA PFP Applicant should demonstrate that it or its Group has an established track record in corporate finance or a related business, of a minimum of five years, in a jurisdiction that has a legislative and regulatory framework that is of comparable standard to that of the FSRA. The PFP Applicant or its Group, where applicable, should also be subject to proper supervision by a competent regulatory authority.\nAlternatively, where a PFP Applicant does not have an established track-record of at least five years or meet the regulatory status requirement, the FSRA may take into account (i) the track record of the PFP Applicant’s Controllers/substantial shareholders and (ii) the experience and qualifications of the PFP Applicant’s key individuals, when assessing the application.\n(c)\tGoverning Body\n(i)\tLicensed Directors – A PFP Applicant which is a Body Corporate incorporated in the ADGM, must register all its Directors with the FSRA in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.4.\n(ii)\tLicensed Partners – A PFP Applicant which is Partnership established in the ADGM, must register all its Partners with the FSRA in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.5.\nThese appointments are not required for PFP Applicants that are branches of legal entities domiciled outside the ADGM.\nThe PFP Applicant must demonstrate that its Governing Body has sufficient collective skills and experience in corporate finance or related fields to oversee the firm’s operations.\n(d)\tMandatory Appointments\nA PFP Applicant must also appoint the following individuals in accordance with GEN Rule 5.5.1:\n(i)\tSenior Executive Officer (“SEO”) – an SEO who is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation, supervision and control of the firm’s operation.

Typically this will drive a Private Credit Fund’s investment policy as stated in the Prospectus and Constitution of the Fund.\nThe risk appetite statement is necessary in order that potential investors in the Fund may understand the type and nature of the Credit Facilities and debt instruments that the Fund intends to invest in and the credit risk profile of the borrowers that the Fund is seeking.\nLending Processes\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund must implement and maintain processes to ensure investments in Credit Facilities are only made based on a stated credit risk assessment and pricing methodology.\nThe Regulator understands that such methodologies may differ amongst Fund Managers of Private Credit Funds in line with the stated risk appetite strategy for their respective Funds, and that lending criteria may differ from the standards adopted by conventional lenders.  The Regulator will expect, however, a Fund Manager to be able to demonstrate robust, defined criteria for lending and how such criteria and methods will operate in practice.\nRisk Management\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund is expected to employ techniques that are appropriate to the risks facing the Fund, including, but not limited ongoing credit and concentration risk.\nFund Managers will inevitably seek to assess the credit risk of each potential borrower as part of its lending process and will also need to demonstrate how they will measure and mitigate those risks on an ongoing basis. Therefore, the Regulator will expect Fund Managers to be able to demonstrate systems and controls that allow changes in the credit risk profile of borrowers to be identified over the duration of each Credit Facility.\nStress Testing\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund must employ stress testing methodologies in order to identify risks that may affect the Fund’s portfolio in adverse scenarios.\nThe Fund Manager must therefore be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that it has systems in place that enable it to regularly stress test the Fund’s portfolio against potential adverse events and market conditions (and combinations thereof).

For the purposes of this Chapter and App4, ""securitisation"" includes Traditional Securitisation, Synthetic Securitisation and Re securitisation, as defined below:\n(a)\tA Traditional Securitisation is a structure where the cash flow from an underlying pool of Exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of Credit Risk. Payments to the investors depend upon the performance of the specified underlying Exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity originating those Exposures. A Traditional Securitisation will generally assume the movement of assets off balance sheet.\n(b)\tA Synthetic Securitisation is a structure with at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches that reflect different degrees of Credit Risk where Credit Risk of an underlying pool of Exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through the use of funded (e.g. CLNs) or unfunded (e.g. credit default swaps) Credit Derivatives or guarantees that serve to hedge the Credit Risk of the portfolio. Accordingly, the investors\' potential risk is dependent upon the performance of the underlying pool. A Synthetic Securitisation may or may not involve the removal of assets off balance sheet.\n(c)\tA Re securitisation Exposure is a securitisation Exposure in which the associated underlying pool of Exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying Exposures is a securitisation Exposure. In addition, an Exposure to one or more Re securitisation Exposures is a Re securitisation Exposure.', ""An Authorised Person which is an Originator or a Sponsor of a Synthetic Securitisation may recognise the credit protection obtained through the Synthetic Securitisation in its calculation of Credit RWA amounts only if all of the following conditions have been complied with:\n(a)\tsignificant Credit Risk associated with the underlying Exposures has been transferred from the Originator to third parties;\n(b)\tthe instrument used to transfer the underlying Credit Risks must not contain terms or conditions that limit in any way the amount of Credit Risk transferred, including, but not limited to, clauses that:\n(i)\tmaterially limit the credit protection or Credit Risk transference (e.g. significant materiality thresholds below which credit protection is deemed not to be triggered even if a credit event occurs or those that allow for the termination of the protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying Exposures);\n(ii)\trequire the Authorised Person to alter the underlying Exposures to improve the weighted average credit quality of the pool;\n(iii)\tincrease the cost of credit protection to the Authorised Person in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying Exposures;\n(iv)\tincrease the yield payable to parties other than the Authorised Person, such as investors and third party providers of Credit Enhancements, in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying Exposures; or\n(v)\tprovide for increases in a retained First Loss Position or Credit Enhancement provided by the originating bank after the transaction's inception.\n(c)\tan Authorised Person must provide an external legal opinion from a qualified legal counsel that confirms each of the points (i v) and the enforceability of the contracts in all relevant jurisdictions;\n(d)\twhere the assets relate to the Islamic Financial Business of an Authorised Person, a written confirmation from the appointed Shari'a Supervisory Board that the securitisation complies with Shari'a;\n(e)\twhere the securitisation includes a Clean Up Call it must meet the requirements of Rule A4.10.3;\n(f)\tin the case where the risks associated with the underlying Exposures are transferred to an SPE:\n(i)\tthe Securities issued by the SPE are not obligations of the Authorised Person;\n(ii)\tthe holders of the beneficial interests in that SPE have the right to pledge or exchange their interests without restriction; and\n(iii)\tthe Authorised Person holds not more than 20% of the aggregate original amount of all Securities issued by the SPE, except where such holdings consist entirely of Securities that have a Credit Quality Grade of 1 in accordance with Rules in Sections 4.11 and 4.12, and all transactions with the SPE are conducted at arm's length and on market terms and conditions;\n(g)\tthe Authorised Person has, on an on going basis, a comprehensive understanding of the risk characteristics of its individual securitisation Exposures, whether on or off balance sheet, as well as the risk characteristics of the pools underlying its securitisation Exposures;\n(h)\tthe Authorised Person is able to access performance information on the underlying Exposures on an on going basis in a timely manner.

For the former of these two purposes, the Insurer is identifying the pool, commonly known as surplus, that is available for allocation as bonuses (or equivalent) on participating policies.  The allocation then reduces the surplus (by convention, this is treated as occurring at the reporting date).

MIR Rule 3.4.2 requires that where such a stipulation is granted to a Recognised Investment Exchange, the Recognised Investment Exchange must meet the requirements of the Virtual Asset Framework in relation to operation of an MTF (using Virtual Assets) while the remainder of its operations must be operated in compliance with the MIR Rules.\n', 'MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nRecognised Investment Exchanges Operating an MTF using Virtual Assets\nThis means that a Recognised Investment Exchange (in addition to operating markets relating to the trading of Financial Instruments (including Digital Securities) can, where permitted by the FSRA and subject to MIR Rule 3.4.2, operate a separate MTF, OTF and/or MTF using Virtual Assets under its Recognition Order.\n', 'MULTILATERAL TRADING FACILITIES AND VIRTUAL ASSETS\nGuidance in relation to Applicable Rules\nChapter 8 of COBS incorporates Rules from various other FSRA Rulebooks that must be complied with, including certain sections of MIR. COBS Rule 8.2.1 sets out various Rules in MIR that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) are required to comply with to the satisfaction of the FSRA, with the applicable Rules set out as follows:\n\na)\tMIR Rule 2.6 (Operational systems and controls):  MIR Rule 2.6.1 requires an MTF to ‘establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other [MTFs], service providers (including outsourcees) and utility providers might pose to itself.’\n\ni.\tIn relation to systems and controls, the FSRA has provided guidance on what it expects in relation to technology governance controls in paragraphs 47 to 92 of this Guidance.  The FSRA therefore requires an MTF to undertake its ‘MTF’ activities in compliance with these operational system and control requirements, in combination with the technology governance controls outlined earlier in this Guidance.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake extensive due diligence and testing of its operational systems and controls, with the relevant reports of such testing capable of being provided to the FSRA for review.  Such testing should be undertaken by an officer of the MTF possessing appropriate skills and experience.  The testing reports need to confirm the robustness of the MTF’s systems and address any potential areas of failure.  Testing should include the settlement processes for the movement of Virtual Assets between wallets, and the general connectivity of the MTF’s systems with other parties.  Testing should be ongoing, building in processes for the introduction of new Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\niii.\tAn MTF will need to provide policies and procedures that clearly evidence how it will effectively address a failure of its systems.  Failures must be rectified as soon as practicable, with an MTF’s business continuity plan including detailed and realistic response timeframes for failures or disruptions.\n\nb)\tMIR Rules 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 (Transaction recording):  FSRA expects that the primary ledger technology systems and controls of an MTF (whether they be DLT or multiple-ledger technologies) will be such that transaction recording and reporting is easily facilitated, and that all FSRA requirements can be effectively complied with.  Where reconciliations are required to be undertaken, for example, between a DLT based ledger and an internal ledger maintained by an MTF for the purposes of transactions and/or settlement, the FSRA will need to be satisfied that the reconciliation process is robust, timely and efficient.\n\nc)\tMIR Rule 2.8 (Membership criteria and access):  MIR Rule 2.8.1 requires that an MTF ‘must ensure that access to its facilities is subject to criteria designed to protect the orderly functioning of the market and the interests of investors’.\n\nAccess Requirements\n\ni.\tMIR Rules 2.8.2, 2.8.3, 2.8.5 and 2.8.6 support the operation of MIR Rule 2.8.1, and the FSRA expects that MTFs consider the application of the requirements across these Rules - for example, MIR Rule 2.8.5 contains substantive provisions that should apply, regardless of what model of ‘access’ an MTF (using Virtual Assets) utilises.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA recognises, however, that MTFs (using Virtual Assets) generally operate an ‘access’ model that does not include Members  (e.g., access is granted directly to (retail and institutional) Clients of the MTF).  An MTF operating in this manner will, therefore, need to ensure that it has appropriate processes, controls and rules to ‘protect the orderly functioning’ of its market, its facilities and the interests of its investors.\n\niii.\tBy not adopting a ‘Member-access’ model and allowing direct ‘Client-access’, MTFs lose one layer of regulatory/supervisory defense that Recognised Investment Exchanges and Member-access MTFs have, in that they do not have Members assisting them in the undertaking of the necessary due diligence and compliance reviews of investors being on-boarded into their market.  The FSRA, in these circumstances, requires MTFs to undertake their own CDD reviews for every client accessing (trading on) their market (something which traditionally a Recognised Investment Exchange or Member-access MTF can rely on its Members to do). Resultant AML/CFT obligations therefore fall more directly on a Client-access MTF as well.\n\niv.\tThe FSRA expects that the controls (and resultant resourcing needs) of an MTF be appropriately budgeted and accounted for, including specific controls for when it has Clients that are institutional Clients (as the current conventional Member/institutional client global regulatory model may not properly account for, and mitigate, the risks relevant to operating such model within the Virtual Asset space).  For example, where an MTF has institutional Clients that are regulated as Authorised Persons (for example, an Authorised Person that is a broker / dealer) within ADGM, the MTF may take comfort from the fact that its Clients are appropriately regulated (including for AML purposes).  An MTF may not, however, take such comfort when its institutional Clients may come from unregulated/less regulated jurisdictions. MTFs with an institutional Client base will therefore need to demonstrate how the MTF will adequately comply with the requirements of the AML Rulebook where its institutional Clients are trading on behalf of further clients.\n\nv.\tGiven the current lack of global regulation of Virtual Asset intermediaries, those MTFs operating a ‘membership model’ will need to assess whether their members are adequately regulated in their home jurisdiction, such that the MTF can suitably rely on their Members, for example, to undertake CDD/AML checks.  Where members are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs will centralise the relevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their ‘members’ for such purposes).\n\nvi.\tDepending on the model, controls and criteria to be adopted by an MTF, the class order modification or waiver relief granted by the FSRA to Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities using Virtual Assets as referred to in paragraph 112 of the Guidance may apply.\n\nRulebook(s)\n\nvii.\tFurther to MIR Rule 2.8, the FSRA expects an MTF to have a rulebook(s) in place.  This rulebook should be clearly labelled as such and be publicly available on the website of the MTF.\n\nviii.\tSupporting documents such as participation agreements, terms of business, product lists, user guides and technical specifications are also a key part of the operation of an MTF, and should be consistent with its rulebook.  The FSRA does not consider that the existence of these documents alone meet the requirement of having a transparent and effective rulebook.  The FSRA considers it good practice that these supporting documents are available and transparent, alongside the published rulebook, to the extent possible.\n\nix.\tThe content of a rulebook  should enable an MTF to demonstrate how it is complying with MIR Rule 2.8, be supported by procedures that are complete and clear, and all in support of an MTF seeking to ensure that behaviour within its market is fair and orderly.\n\nx.\tThe FSRA expects MTFs to require explicit acknowledgement via a user agreement, that participants have read, understood and will abide by the rulebook at all times.\n\nxi.\tThe FSRA expects an MTF to undertake regular reviews of its rulebook to ensure it is consistent with relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.  Best practice may see such activity undertaken no less than every twelve-months.\n\nd)\tMIR Rule 2.9 (Financial crime and market abuse):  MTFs are required to operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor, detect and prevent conduct amounting to market misconduct and/or Financial Crime. Given the significant risks, and the nascent nature and constant pace of development of the Virtual Asset industry, an MTF’s surveillance system will need to be robust, and regularly reviewed and enhanced.\n\ni.\tThe FSRA recognises that an MTF outside ADGM may not be subject to a similar regulatory standard as that which applies within ADGM.  The FSRA recommends, therefore, that MTFs spend the time to consider the application of MIR Rules 2.9.1 to 2.9.3, which technology, systems and controls they propose to use for these purposes, and the associated resourcing needs required to undertake these functions appropriately.  For this reason, among others set out in this Guidance, the FSRA is of the view that it is not appropriate for an MTF to outsource its compliance / market surveillance functions.\n\nii.\tThe FSRA further reminds MTFs, and investors trading on an MTF, of the Market Abuse provisions applicable to the trading of Accepted Virtual Assets on an MTF.\n\ne)\tMIR Rule 2.11 (Rules and consultation): To meet MIR Rules 2.11.1 to 2.11.11, an MTF must ensure that it has appropriate procedures in place for it to make rules, for keeping its rules under review, for consulting and for amending its rules.  MIR Rule 2.11.2 requires proposed rule changes be subject to FSRA approval.\n\nf)\tMIR Rule 3.3 (Fair and orderly trading): MIR Rules 3.3.1 to 3.3.4 establish the requirements an MTF must meet for providing fair and orderly trading across its market, and for having objective criteria for the efficient execution of orders.  The FSRA considers these requirements to be fundamental to the operation of an MTF.\n\ng)\tCOBS Rule 8.3.1 & MIR Rule 3.7 (Public disclosure):\n\ni.\tAny arrangements of an MTF used to make information public (including trading information required to be disclosed under COBS Rule 8.3.1) must satisfy a number of conditions, including that it is reliable, monitored continuously, and made available to the public on a non-discriminatory basis. While an MTF can choose the format structure to be used for dissemination, MIR Rule 3.7.4 requires it to conform to a consistent and structured format.\n\nii.\tIn terms of the timing of disclosure of MTF trading information, the FSRA recognises that current virtual asset industry practice is for such trading information to be released on a real-time basis (in alignment with current practice for trading within spot commodity markets, but different to the current industry/regulatory practice of delayed data within certain securities/derivatives markets).  The FSRA is not proposing any additional specific requirements at this stage (to those already applicable in COBS Rule 8.3.1 and MIR Rule 3.7), but will continue to monitor industry practice.\n\nh)\tMIR Rule 3.8 (Settlement and Clearing Services): An MTF will need to have clear processes in place for the settlement (and if applicable, the clearing) of all Accepted Virtual Asset transactions.  As noted in the AML and Technology Governance sections of this Guidance, extensive stress testing on capabilities to connect successfully with third parties, and in relation to the movement of Accepted Virtual Assets between wallets, will be required to be undertaken to the FSRA’s satisfaction.  The FSRA will not necessarily require a connection to a separate Recognised (or Remote) Clearing House where the MTF can demonstrate that it has in place ‘satisfactory arrangements for the timely discharge, Clearing and settlement of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions effected’ on the MTF, including where it is utilising the services of a Virtual Asset Custodian.\n\ni)\tMIR Rule 3.10 (Default Rules): Depending on whether an MTF operates a ‘Member-access’ model or it allows direct ‘Client-access’ will determine the full, or partial, application of MIR Rules 3.10.1 to 3.10.3.  The FSRA, at a minimum, expects MTFs to have in place both rules and a process to suspend or terminate access to its markets in circumstances where a Client/Member is unable to meet its obligations in respect of transactions relating to Accepted Virtual Assets.\n\ni.\tThe FSRA suggests that an Applicant/Authorised Person consider different scenarios/circumstances where it may need to utilise the powers provided to it under its Default Rules, and take appropriate action as required.  Scenario testing of this kind could relate to when there is a financial and/or technical ‘default’ in relation to, for example, its custody, fiat token or wider banking arrangements. Due to a prevalence of pre-funding of (client) positions within Virtual Asset markets, the impact of a ‘default’ in such a scenario may not necessarily be on a per-transaction basis, but could be structural in nature, in limiting the ability of Clients to fund their positions (and therefore the ability of the MTF to operate on a fair and orderly basis).\n\nii.\tTo prepare for the event of a loss/default, the FSRA expects an MTF to have, within its policies, a clear process for the management of such loss (e.g., what is the exposure of individual Clients, counterparties, its Custodian and itself, as applicable).\n\n']"

The rapid growth of the VA sector and evolution of its enabling technology has seen financial regulators across the globe responding with a variety of approaches, including but not limited to prohibition, restrictions and forbearance. The FSRA believes that bringing definable VA activities within its regulatory perimeter ensures greater oversight and mitigation of the risks inherent in the sector. This approach also addresses the expectations of both best-in-class innovators and traditional financial institutions that seek the transparency and consistency of a regulated environment for a nascent asset class.', 'Principle 4 – Risk-Sensitive Supervision . Whilst financial crime is seen as a primary risk in the sector at this point in its growth, ADGM’s framework also includes safeguards aligned with its mandate to ensure market integrity, investor protection and financial stability. As a forward-looking regulator, the FSRA implemented these safeguards at the outset to prevent the commensurate increase in risk as the sector undergoes expansion within ADGM. Therefore, the following risk drivers receive heightened focus from the FSRA in its supervisory programme:\n(a)\tCustody of VAs – even where outsourced to a third party, a VA custodian is held to the requirements applicable to client monies and client investments. Enhanced reconciliation and reporting requirements are also in place.\n(b)\tTechnology and Governance Controls – whilst being ‘technology-neutral’, we have bespoke requirements reflecting the intensive technology-related operations of VA firms, including: the maintenance of operating systems; cryptographic keys and wallet storage; password encryption; origin/destination of VA funds; and fork protocols.\n(c)\tExchange-Type Operations – the ‘fair and orderly trading’ and Market Abuse requirements for Financial Instruments admitted to trading on trading venues in ADGM are equally applicable to VAs traded on an MTF in ADGM. Real time reporting is required for all transactions on such platforms. Requirements relating to settlement, transaction recording, rulebooks and access, among many others, also apply.\n(d)\tInvestor Protection – we have set high standards around product suitability, communication of material risks to clients and resolution of perceived client conflicts. VA firms are required to monitor and update their risk disclosures on a continuous basis.']"

Takaful is the Shari'a-compliant equivalent of conventional insurance, and exists in both the form of Family (or Life) Takaful and General Takaful. Takaful is derived from an Arabic word that means joint guarantee, whereby a group of participants agree among themselves to support one another jointly for the losses arising from specified risks. In a Takaful arrangement the participants contribute a sum of money as a Tabarru’ commitment into a common fund that will be used mutually to assist the members against a specified type of loss or damage. The underwriting in Takaful is thus undertaken on a mutual basis, similar in some respects to conventional mutual insurance. A typical Takaful Provider consists of a two-tier structure that is a hybrid of a mutual and a commercial form of company although in principle it could be a pure mutual structure.  The Takaful Operator’s role is generally confined to managing the Takaful activities and investing the fund assets in accordance with Shari'a."", ""Nevertheless, there are some Family Takaful products, such as group Takaful or term Takaful, that do not necessarily involve a long-term relationship between the Takaful undertakings and the Takaful participants. These products offer a shorter period of coverage and, as such, they have no investment element in favour of the participants. Normally, these types of products would work on a similar mechanism to General Takaful, whereby all Takaful contributions are considered as Tabarru' and credited directly into the PRF."", 'Where an insurer or an insurance intermediary conducts Takaful with a Retail Client, the disclosure for the purposes of COBS 6.7 must include:\n(a)\tthe nature of the contracts between the Takaful Fund and the Takaful Operator;\n(b)\tthe method of calculation of any fees or share of profits paid from the Takaful Fund to the Takaful Operator;\n(c)\tthe basis on which any surpluses in the Takaful Fund will be shared; and\n(d)\tany circumstances in which additional contributions to the Takaful Fund may be required.']"

ADGM’s legal system is based on English common law, a number of English statutes (implemented locally and consistently with the English form) and ADGM enactments which have been primarily drafted from English statutory precedents and, partly, from those of other commercially respected common law jurisdictions. There are many advantages of ADGM’s approach to implementing English law, as set out below. Practitioners and businesses operating in ADGM may find it helpful to familiarise themselves with ADGM’s approach.', 'Two main groups of statute law have effect in the ADGM: (i) the 47 modified English statutes scheduled to the Application Regulations; and (ii) other enactments passed by ADGM. The first group includes statutes that make modifications to common law rules and other standalone commercial statutes. The second group comprises key ADGM enactments for commercial activity which are primarily based on precedent statutes from the UK and are up to date, fitting snugly with the common law. For the first group, the Application Regulations specify exactly which statutory modifications of common law rules have effect in the ADGM’s legal system. Future statutory modifications passed in the UK will not have effect in ADGM. The underlying common law precedent is to be referred to disregarding them, unless another ADGM enactment has expressly stated that they shall apply in ADGM.  Existing statutory modifications have effect in ADGM only to the extent that they are included in the 47 English statutes scheduled to the Application Regulations or are included in another ADGM enactment. Key statutory modifications and other general English commercial statutes relevant to modern business have been included in the ADGM’s body of statute law and were selected as a result of a review of key English commercial statutes and were publicly consulted upon.\n', 'The manner in which ADGM has developed its statutory law, as implemented under the 47 English statutes and ADGM’s regulations has these advantages:\n(i)\tGeneral approach to statute law: ADGM has not attempted to codify common law rules into statutory codes. ADGM has produced consolidated versions of the 47 English statutes as modified which are scheduled to the Application Regulations for ease of use. As these statutes have been implemented locally and consistently with their UK form, they should benefit from the existing English case law that interprets and applies analogous provisions. As ADGM’s other enactments have also been drafted from precedent statutes from the UK and other commercially renowned jurisdictions they inherit the precedential value of common law cases interpreting and applying those statutes, which can usefully be considered in the ADGM courts.\n(ii)\tImprovements: ADGM has, in its individual reflection of precedent statutes from the UK and other common law jurisdictions, made useful improvements and modifications which businesses and practitioners in ADGM may find it worth familiarising themselves with. ADGM’s improvements and modifications have been clearly identified in the relevant legislative consultation papers which are publicly available online. For example the following concepts have been omitted in ADGM’s Companies and Insolvency Regulations: (i) memoranda of association; (ii) share nominal value; and (iii) company voluntary arrangements.  Other improvements made include the addition of “restricted scope companies”, “cell companies” and removals of restrictions on returning capital to limited partners in limited liability partnerships.

It sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as common due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions.\nThe Standard consists of the following four key parts:\n•\tA model Competent Authority Agreement (CAA), providing the international legal framework for the automatic exchange of CRS information;\n•\tThe Common Reporting Standard;\n•\tThe Commentaries on the CAA and the CRS; and\n•\tThe CRS XML Schema User Guide.”\nFor the purposes of the UAE CRS Regulations, the Common Reporting Standard Commentary and FAQs, which is any explanatory material made and published by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) for the purpose of assisting with the interpretation of the Common Reporting Standard, is an integral part of the Common Reporting Standard and accordingly applies for the purposes of the automatic exchange of financial account information.\nThe UAE Financial Institutions should consult documentation issued, from time to time, by the OECD for clarification and the CRS commentary and FAQs, for example:\n•\tStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters\n•\tStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters - Implementation Handbook\n•\tCRS FAQs.\nThe above documents are published on the OECD website: http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ and https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/.', 'LEGAL BASIS\nIn accordance with the Cabinet Decision Number 16/9W of year 2016, the UAE Government had committed itself to sign (i) the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) and (ii) the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (MCAA).
